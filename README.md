# What is WEKA?
WEKA is a suite of Machine Learning software written in Java. Algorithms can be applied in to a dataset or using an original Java code.

# Our Application of WEKA
Josh wrote an algorithm for a weather application. In this case, the accuracy classifying for a windy day and daily outlook.

# The Java Application
The class is named "Project5MachineLearning", which takes a text file named "weather.txt", and reads the contents of said text file. Note: make sure that the text file is located in the same directory as the .java file.
